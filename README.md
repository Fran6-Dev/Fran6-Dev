### Nice to meet you ! 👋

My name is Francis and i'm a front end developer 😁

# Background 📚

Initially graduated in master marketing, I suddenly found a passion for the world of web development. I was interested in the world of the web while finishing my studies. As a result, I started a web developer training in order to change my career direction. I am now a newly graduated web developer at OpenClassroom.

# Project 💻

I have therefore developed several projects with the objective of acquiring the necessary skills to enable me to progress as efficiently as possible.

Here are the languages and tools in which I could code my various projects :
